define a function "factorial" with parameters "n" as an integer that {
    if n < 0 then {
        return -1 // Undefined
    }

    if n = 0 then {
        return 1
    }

    set "result" as integer to 1

    while n > 0 then {
        set total to total * n 
        set n to n - 1
    }

    return result
}

input to "number" as integer
call factorial using number setting "numberFactorial" to the returned value
output "The factorial of "
output number
output " is "
output numberFactorial
